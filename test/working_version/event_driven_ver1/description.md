These are two example sketches that implement a realistic “ping–pong” between a leader and a follower. In this example, the leader starts by sending a value (1) in a message with CAN ID 0x200. When the follower receives this message, its callback adds 1 (so it becomes 2) and immediately sends a feedback message with CAN ID 0x300. On the leader side, the callback for ID 0x300 updates its current value with the feedback; if the value exceeds 100, it resets it to 1. Then the leader sends the new value on the next cycle.
